# Monte-Carlo-Race-Simulator
## Overview

The Monte Carlo Race Simulator is an advanced simulation tool designed to model race scenarios using Monte Carlo methods. This tool enables teams to predict race outcomes by running thousands of simulations with randomised variables, such as lap times, pit stop durations, and tyre wear rates.

By analysing a distribution of potential outcomes, this simulator provides critical insights into probabilities for podium finishes, optimal pit stop strategies, and the impact of external factors like safety cars or changing track conditions. The tool is highly customisable and suitable for Formula E, Formula 1, and other racing series.


## Features

- **Probabilistic Analysis**: Run thousands of simulations to predict race outcomes under various scenarios.
- **Customisable Inputs**: Define parameters like race length, lap variability, pit stop timings, and tyre degradation.
- **Insightful Visualisation**: Generate probability distributions and expected race outcomes.
- **Multi-Series Support**: Tailored for multiple racing series.
